    <p>SECTION 2 MATERIALS, WORKSMANSHIP, INSPECTION AND TESTING</p>
    <p><b>5 MATERIALS</b></p>
    <p><b>5.1 Cement</b></p>
    <p>The cement used shall be any of the following and the type selected should be appropriate for the intended
        use;


    <ol start="1">
        <li>33 Grade ordinary Portland cement conforming to IS 269</li>
        <li>43 Grade ordinary Portland cement conforming to IS 8112</li>
        <li>53 Grade ordinary Portland cement conforming to IS 12269</li>
        <li>Rapid hardening Portland cement conforming to IS 8041</li>
        <li>Portland slag cement conforming to IS 455</li>
        <li>Portland pozzolana cement (fly ash based) conforming to IS 1489 (Part 1)</li>
        <li>Portland pozzolana cement (calcined clay based) conforming to IS 1489 (Part 2)</li>
        <li>Hydrophobic cement conforming to IS 8043</li>
        <li>Low heat Portland cement conforming to IS 12600</li>
        <li>Sulphate resisting Portland cement conforming to IS 12330</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Other combinations of Portland cement with mineral admixtures (see 5.2) of quality conforming with relevant
        Indian Standards laid down may also be used in the manufacture of concrete provided that there are satisfactory
        data on their suitability, such as performance test on concrete containing them.</p>
    <p><b>5.1.1</b> Low heat Portland cement conforming to IS 12600 shall be used with adequate precautions with regard
        to removal of formwork, etc.</p>
    <p><b>5.1.2 </b>High alumina cement conforming to IS 6452 or super-sulphated cement conforming to IS 6909 may be
        used only under special circumstances with the prior approval of the engineer-in-charge. Specialist literature
        may be consulted for guidance regarding the use of these types of cements,</p>
    <p><b>5.1.3</b> The attention of the engineers-in-charge and users of cement is drawn to the fact that quality of
        various cements mentioned in 5.1 is to be determined on the basis of its conformity to the performance
        characteristics given in the respective Indian Standard Specification for that cement. Any trade-mark or any
        trade name indicating any special features not covered in the standard or any qualification or other special
        performance characteristics sometimes claimed/ indicated on the bags or containers or in advertisements
        alongside the 'Statutory Quality Marking' or otherwise have no relation whatsoever with the characteristics
        guaranteed by the Quality Marking as relevant to that cement. Consumers are, therefore, advised to go by the
        characteristics as given in the corresponding Indian Standard Specification or seek specialist advise to avoid
        any problem in concrete making and construction.</p>
    <p><b>5.2 Mineral Admixtures</b></p>
    <p><b>5.2.1</b> Pozzolans</p>
    <p>Pozzolanic materials conforming to relevant Indian Standards may be used with the permission of the
        engineer-in-charge, provided uniform blending with cement is ensured.</p>
    <p><b>5.2.1.1</b> Fly ash (pulverized fuel ash)</p>
    <p>Fly ash conforming to Grade 1 of IS 3812 may be used as part replacement of ordinary Portland cement provided
        uniform blending with cement is ensured.</p>
    <p><b>5.2.1.2</b> Silica fume</p>
    <p>Silica fume conforming to a standard approved by the deciding authority may be used as part replacement of cement
        provided uniform blending with the cement is ensured.</p>
    <p>NOTE-The silica fume (very fine non-crystalline silicon dioxide) is a by-product of the manufacture of silicon,
        ferrosilicon or the like, from quartz and carbon in electric arc furnace. It is usually used in proportion of 5
        to 10 percent of the cement content of a mix.</p>
    <p><b>5.2.1.3 </b>Rice husk ash</p>
    <p>Rice husk ash giving required performance and uniformity characteristics may be used with the approval of the
        deciding authority.</p>
    <p>NOTE-Rice husk ash is produced by burning rice husk and contain large proportion of silica. To achieve amorphous
        state, rice husk may be burnt at controlled temperature. It is necessary to evaluate the product from a
        particular source for performance and uniformity since it can range from being as deleterious as silt when
        incorporated in concrete. Water demand and drying shrinkage should be studied before using rice husk.</p>
    <p><b>5.2.1.4 </b>Metakaoline</p>
    <p>Metakaoline having fineness between 700 to 900 m<sup>2</sup>/kg may be used as pozzolanic material in concrete.
    </p>
    <p>NOTE-Metakaoline is obtained by calcination of pure or refined kaolintic clay at a temperature between 650°C and
        850°C, followed by grinding to achieve a fineness of 700 to 900 m<sup>2</sup>/kg. The resulting material has
        high pozzolanicity.</p>
    <p><b>5.2.2</b> Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag</p>
    <p>Ground granulated blast furnace slag obtained by grinding granulated blast furnace slag conforming to IS 12089
        may be used as part replacement of ordinary Portland cement provided uniform blending with cement is ensured.
    </p>
    <p><b>5.3 Aggregates</b></p>
    <p>Aggregates shall comply with the requirements of IS 383. As far as possible preference shall be given to natural
        aggregates.</p>
    <p><b>5.3.1</b> Other types of aggregates such as slag and crushed overburnt brick or tile, which may be found
        suitable with regard to strength, durability of concrete and freedom from harmful effects may be used for plain
        concrete members, but such aggregates should not contain more than 0.5 percent of sulphates as SO<sub>3</sub>
        and should not absorb more than 10 percent of their own mass of water.</p>
    <p><b>5.3.2</b> Heavy weight aggregates or light weight aggregates such as bloated clay aggregates and sintered fly
        ash aggregates may also be used provided the engineer-in-charge is satisfied with the data on the properties of
        concrete made with them.</p>
    <p>NOTE-Some of the provisions of the code would require modification when these aggregates are used; specialist
        literature may be consulted for guidance,</p>
    <p><b>5.3.3</b> Size of Aggregate</p>
    <p>The nominal maximum size of coarse aggregate should be as large as possible within the limits specified but in no
        case greater than one-fourth of the minimum thickness of the member, provided that the concrete can be placed
        without difficulty so as to surround all. reinforcement thoroughly and fill the corners of the form. For most
        work, 20 mm aggregate is suitable. Where there is no restriction to the flow of concrete into sections, 40 mm or
        larger size may be permitted. In concrete elements with thin sections, closely spaced reinforcement or small
        cover, consideration should be given to the use of 10 mm nominal maximum size.</p>
    <p>Plums above 160 mm and up to any reasonable size may be used in plain concrete work up to a maximum limit of 20
        percent by volume of concrete when specifically permitted by the engineer-in-charge. The plums shall be
        distributed evenly and shall be not closer than 150 mm from the surface.</p>
    <p><b>5.3.3.1</b> For heavily reinforced concrete members as in the case of ribs of main beams, the nominal. maximum
        size of the aggregate should usually be restricted to 5 mm less than the minimum clear distance between the main
        bars or 5 mm less than the minimum cover to the reinforcement whichever is smaller.</p>
    <p><b>5.3.4</b> Coarse and fine aggregate shall be batched separately. All-in-aggregate may be used only where
        specifically permitted by the engineer-in-charge.</p>
    <p><b>5.4 Water</b></p>
    <p>Water used for mixing and curing shall be clean and free from injurious amounts of oils, acids, alkalis, salts,
        sugar, organic materials or other substances that may be deleterious to concrete or steel.</p>
    <p>Potable water is generally considered satisfactory for mixing concrete. As a guide the following concentrations
        represent the maximum permissible values:</p>
    <ol start="11">
        <li>To neutralize 100 ml sample of water, using phenolphthalein as an indicator, it should not require more than
            5 ml of 0.02 normal NaOH. The details of test are given in 8.1 of IS 3025 (Part 22).</li>
        <li>To neutralize 100 ml sample of water, using mixed indicator, it should not require more than 25 ml of 0.02
            normal H<sub>2</sub>SO, The details of test shall be as given in 8 of IS 3025 (Part 23).</li>
        <li>Permissible limits for solids shall be as given in Table 1.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>5.4.1</b> In case of doubt regarding development of strength, the suitability of water for making concrete
        shall be ascertained by the compressive strength and initial setting time tests specified in 5.4.1.2 and
        5.4.1.3.</p>
    <p><b>5.4.1.1 </b>The sample of water taken for testing shall represent the water proposed to be used for
        concreting, due account being paid to seasonal variation. The sample shall not receive any treatment before
        testing other than that envisaged in the regular supply of water proposed for use in concrete. The sample shall
        be stored in a clean container previously rinsed out with similar water.</p>
    <p><b>5.4.1.2 </b>Average 28 days compressive strength of at least three 150 mm concrete cubes prepared with water
        proposed to be used shall not be less than 90 percent of the average of strength of three similar concrete cubes
        prepared with distilled water. The cubes shall be prepared, cured and tested in accordance with the requirements
        of IS 516.</p>
    <p><b>5.4.1.3 </b>The initial setting time of test block made with the appropriate cement and the water proposed to
        be used shall not be less than 30 min and shall not differ by ± 30 min from the initial setting time of control
        test block prepared with the same cement and distilled water. The test blocks shall be prepared and tested in
        accordance with the requirements of IS 4031 (Part 5).</p>
    <p><b>5.4.2</b> The pH value of water shall be not less than 6.</p>
    <p><b>5.4.3</b> Sea Water</p>
    <p id="h.1fob9te">Mixing or curing of concrete with sea water is not recommended because of presence of harmful
        salts in sea water. Under unavoidable circumstances sea water may be used for mixing or curing in plain concrete
        with no embedded steel after having given due consideration to possible disadvantages and precautions including
        use of appropriate cement system.</p>

    <p>NOTES</p>
    <p>1.In the designation of concrete mix M refers to the mix and the number to the specified compressive strength of
        150 mm size cube at 28 days, expressed in N/rnrn2</p>
    <p>2.For concrete of compressive strength greater than M 55, design parameters given in the standard may not be
        applicable and the values may be obtained from specialized literatures and experimental results.</p>
    <p>justify a higher strength for a particular structure due to age.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.1.1</b> For concrete of grade M 30 and above, the rate of increase of compressive strength with age shall
        be based on actual investigations.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.1.2</b> Where members are subjected to lower direct load during construction, they should be checked for
        stresses resulting from combination of direct load and bending during construction.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.2</b> Tensile Strength of Concrete</p>
    <p>The flexural and splitting tensile strengths shall be obtained as described in IS 516 and IS 5816 respectively.
        When the designer wishes to use an estimate of the tensile strength from the compressive strength, the following
        formula may be used:</p>
    <p>Flexural Strength, f<sub>ck</sub> = 0.7 √f<sub>ck </sub>N/mm<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>where f<sub>ck</sub> is the characteristic cube compressive strength of concrete in N/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.3</b> Elastic Deformation</p>
    <p>The modulus of elasticity is primarily influenced by the elastic properties of the aggregate and to a lesser
        extent by the conditions of curing and age of the concrete, the mix proportions and the type of cement. The
        modulus of elasticity is normally related to the compressive strength of concrete.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.3.1</b> The modulus of elasticity of concrete can be assumed as follows:</p>
    <p>E<sub>c</sub> = 5000 √f<sub>ck</sub></p>
    <p>where,</p>
    <p>E<sub>c</sub> is the short-term static modulus of elasticity in N/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>Actual measured values may differ by ± 20 percent from the values obtained from the above expression.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.4</b> Shrinkage</p>
    <p>The total shrinkage of concrete depends upon the constituents of concrete, size of the member and environmental
        conditions. For a given humidity and temperature, the total shrinkage of concrete is most influenced by the
        total amount of water present in the concrete at the time of mixing and, to a lesser extent, by the cement
        content.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.4.1</b> In the absence of test data, the approximate value of the total shrinkage strain for design may be
        taken as 0.0003 (for more information, see IS 1343):</p>
    <p><b>6.2.5</b> Creep of Concrete</p>
    <p>Creep of concrete depends, in addition to the factors listed in <b>6.2.4,</b> on the stress in the concrete, age
        at loading and the duration of loading. As long as the stress in concrete does not exceed one-third of its
        characteristic compressive strength, creep may be assumed to be proportional to the stress.</p>
    <p><b>6.2.5.1</b> In the absence of experimental data and detailed information on the effect of the variables, the
        ultimate creep strain may be estimated from the following values of creep coefficient (that is, ultimate creep
        strain/ elastic strain at the age of loading); for long span structure, it is advisable to, determine actual
        creep strain, likely to take place:</p><a id="t.93191fab7b2b010add780c197fb64671f5da311e"></a><a id="t.2"></a>

    <p id="h.1t3h5sf"><b>8 DURABILITY OF CONCRETE</b></p>
    <p><b>8.1. General</b></p>
    <p>A durable concrete is one that performs satisfactorily in the working environment during its anticipated exposure
        conditions during service. The material sand mix proportions specified and used should be such as to maintain
        its integrity and, if applicable, to protect embedded metal from corrosion.</p>
    <p><b>8.1.1</b> One of the main characteristics influencing the durability of concrete is its permeability to the
        ingress of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide. chloride, sulphate and other potentially deleterious substances.
        Impermeability is governed by the constituent sand workmanship used in making the concrete. With normal-weight
        aggregates a suitably low permeability is achieved by having an adequate cement content sufficiently low free
        water/ cement ratio, by ensuring complete compaction of the concrete. and by adequate curing.</p>
    <p>The factors influencing durability include:</p>
    <p>a) the environment;</p>
    <p>b) the cover to embedded steel;</p>
    <p>c) the type and quality of constituent materials;</p>
    <p>d) the cement content and water/cement ratio of the concrete;</p>
    <p>e) workmanship, to obtain full compaction and efficient curing; and</p>
    <p>f) the shape and size of the member.</p>
    <p>The degree of exposure anticipated for the concrete during its service life together with other relevant factors
        relating to mix composition. workmanship. design and detailing should be considered. The concrete mix to provide
        adequate durability under these conditions should be.chosen taking account of the accuracy of current testing
        regimes for control and compliance as described in this standard.</p>
    <p id="h.4d34og8"><b>8.2 Requirements for Durability</b></p>
    <p><b>8.2.1 </b>Shape and Size of Member</p>
    <p>The shape or design details of exposed structures should be such as to promote good drainage of water and to
        avoid standing pools and rundown of water. Care should also be taken to minimize any cracks that may collect or
        transmit water. Adequate curing is essential to avoid the harmful effects of early loss of rnoisture (see
        <b>13.5</b>)..Member profiles and their intersections with other members shall be designed and detailed in a way
        to ensure easy flow of concrete and proper compaction during concreting.
    </p>
    <p>Concrete is more vulnerable to deterioration due to chemical or climatic attack when it is in thin sections, in
        sections under hydrostatic pressure from one side only, in partially immersed sections and at comers and edges
        of elements. The life of the structure can be lengthened by providing extra cover to steel, by chamfering the
        corners or by using circular cross-sections or by using surface coatings which prevent or reduce the ingress of
        water, carbon dioxide or aggressive chemicals.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.2 </b>Exposure Conditions</p>
    <p><b>8.2.2.1 </b>General environment</p>
    <p>The general environment to which the concrete will be exposed during its working life is classified into five
        levels of severity, that is, mild, moderate, severe, very severe and extreme as described in Table 3.</p>

    <ol start="1">
        <li>Cement content given in this table is irrespective of grades of cement.</li>
        <li>Use of supersulphated cement is generally restricted where the prevailing temperature is above 40°C.</li>
        <li>Supersulphated cement gives an acceptable life provided that the concrete is dense and prepared with a
            water~cement ratio of 0.4 or less, in mineral acids, down to pH 3.5.</li>
        <li>The cement contents given in col 6 of this table are the minimum recommended. For SOl contents near the
            upper limit of any class, cement contents above these minimum are advised.</li>
        <li>For severe conditions, such as thin sections under hydrostatic pressure on one side only and sections partly
            immersed, considerations should be given to a further reduction of water cement ratio.</li>
        <li>Portland slag cement conforming to IS' 455 with slag content more than 50 percent exhibits better sulphate
            resisting properties.</li>
        <li>Where chloride is encountered along with sulphates in soil or groundwater, ordinary Portland cement with
            C<sub>3</sub>A content from 5 to 8 percent shall be desirable to be used in concrete, instead of sulphate
            resisting cement. Alternatively, Portland slag cement conforming to IS 455 having more than 50 percent slag
            or a blend of ordinary Portland cement and slag may be used provided sufficient information is available on
            performance of such blended cements in these conditions.</li>

    <p><b>8.2.5</b> Mix Constituents</p>
    <p><b>8.2.5.1</b> General</p>
    <p>For concrete to be durable, careful selection of the mix and materials is necessary, so that deleterious
        constituents do not exceed the limits.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.5.2</b> Chlorides in concrete</p>
    <p>Whenever there is chloride in concrete there is an increased risk of corrosion of embedded metal. The higher the
        chloride content, or if subsequently exposed to warm moist conditions, the greater the risk of corrosion. All
        constituents may contain chlorides and concrete may be contaminated by chlorides from the external environment.
        To minimize the chances of deterioration of concrete from harmful chemical salts, the levels of such harmful
        salts in concrete coming from concrete materials, that is, cement, aggregates water and admixtures, as well as
        by diffusion from the environment should be limited. The total amount of</p>
    <p>chloride content (as CI) .in the concrete at the time of placing shall be as given in Table 7.</p>
    <p>The total acid soluble chloride content should be calculated from the mix proportions and the measured chloride
        contents of each of the constituents. Wherever possible, the total chloride content of the concrete should be
        determined.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.5.3 </b>Sulphates in concrete</p>
    <p>Sulphates are present in most cements and in some aggregates; excessive amounts of water-soluble sulphate from
        these or other mix constituents can cause expansion and di~ruption of concrete. To prevent this, the total
        water-soluble sulphate content of the concrete mix, expressed as SO<sub>3</sub>, should not exceed 4 percent by
        mass of the cement in the mix. The sulphate content should be calculated as the total from the various
        constituents of the mix.</p>
    <p>The 4 percent limit does not apply to concrete made with supersulphated cement complying with IS 6909.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.5.4</b> Alkali-aggregate reaction</p>
    <p>Some aggregates containing particular varieties of silica may be susceptible to attack by alkalis
        (Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O) originating from cement or other sources, producing an expansive reaction
        which can cause cracking and disruption of concrete. Damage to concrete from this reaction will normally only
        occur when all the following are present together:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>A high moisture level, within the concrete;</li>
        <li>A cement with high alkali content, or another source of alkali;</li>
        <li>Aggregate containing an alkali reactive constituent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Where the service records of particular cement/aggregate combinations are well established, and do not include
        any instances of cracking due to alkali-aggregate reaction, no further precautions should be necessary. When the
        materials are unfamiliar, precautions should take one at more or the following forms:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Use of non-reactive aggregate from alternate sources.</li>

    <p>Further advantage can be obtained by use of fly ash (Grade 1) conforming to IS 3812 or granulated blast furnace
        slag conforming to IS 12089 as part replacement of ordinary Portland cement (having total alkali content as
        Na<sub>2</sub>O equivalent not more than 0.6 percent), provided ash content is at least 20 percent or slag
        content is at least 50 percent.</p>

    <p><b>8.2.6 </b>Concrete in Aggressive Soils and Water</p>
    <p><b>8.2.6.1</b> General</p>
    <p>The destructive action of aggressive waters on concrete is progressive. The rate of deterioration decreases as
        the concrete is made stronger and more impermeable, and increases as the salt content of the water increases.
        Where structures are only partial1y immersed or are in contact with aggressive soils or waters on one side only,
        evaporation may cause serious concentrations of salts with subsequent deterioration, even where the original
        salt content of the soil or water is not high.</p>
    <p>NOTE-Guidance regarding requirements for concrete exposed to sulphate attack is given in 8.2.2.4.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.6.2</b> Drainage</p>
    <p>At sites where alkali concentrations are high or may become very high, the ground water should be lowered by
        drainage so that it will not come into direct contact with the concrete.</p>
    <p>Additional protection may be obtained by the use of chemically resistant stone facing or a layer of plaster of
        Paris covered with suitable fabric, such as jute thoroughly impregnated with bituminous material.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.7</b> Compaction, Finishing and Curing</p>
    <p>Adequate compaction without segregation should be ensured by providing suitable workability and by employing
        appropriate placing and compacting equipment and procedures. Full compaction is particularly important in the
        vicinity of construction and movement joints and of embedded water bars and reinforcement.</p>
    <p>Good finishing practices are essential for durable concrete.</p>
    <p>Overworking the surface and the addition of water! cement to aid in finishing should be avoided; the resulting
        laitance will have impaired strength and durability and will be particularly Vulnerable to freezing and thawing
        under wet conditions.</p>
    <p>It is essential to use proper and adequate curing techniques to reduce the permeability of the concrete. and
        enhance its durability by extending the hydration of the cement, particularly in its surface zone (see
        <b>13.5</b>).
    </p>
    <p><b>8.2.8 </b>Concrete in Sea-water</p>
    <p>Concrete in sea-water or exposed directly along the sea coast shall be at least M 20 Grade in the case of plain
        concrete and M30 in case of reinforced concrete. The use of slag or pozzolana cement is advantageous under such
        conditions.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.8.1</b> Special attention shall be given to the design of the mix to obtain the densest possible concrete;
        slag, broken brick, soft limestone, soft sandstone, or other porous or weak aggregates shall not be used.</p>
    <p><b>8.2.8.2</b> As far as possible, preference shall be given to precast members unreinforced, well-cured and

    <p><b>9.1.1</b> The determination of the proportions of cement, aggregates and water to attain the required
        strengths shall be made as follows:</p>
    <p>a) By designing the concrete mix; such concrete shall be called 'Design mix concrete', or</p>
    <p>b) By adopting nominal concrete mix; such concrete shall be called 'Nominal mix concrete'.</p>
    <p>Design mix concrete is preferred to nominal mix. If design mix concrete cannot be used for any reason on the work
        for grades of M 20 or lower, nominal mixes may be used with the permission of engineer-in-charge, which,
        however, is likely to involve a higher cement content.</p>

        there is no change in source and the quality of the materials.</p>
    <p><b>9.2.4 </b>Standard Deviation</p>
    <p>The standard deviation for each grade of concrete shall be calculated, separately.</p>

        obtain the 30 samples, as early as possible, when a mix is used for the first time.</p>
    <p>b) In case of significant changes in concrete- When significant changes are made in the production of concrete
        batches (for example changes in the materials used, mix design, equipment or technical control), the standard
        deviation value shall be separately calculated for such batches of concrete.</p>

    <p>The construction should result in satisfactory strength, serviceability and long term durability so as to lower.
        the overall life-cycle cost. Quality assurance in construction activity relates to proper design. use of
        adequate materials and components to be supplied by the producers, proper workmanship in the execution of works
        by the contractor and ultimately proper care during the use of structure including timely maintenance and repair
        by the owner.</p>
    <p><b>10.1.2</b> Quality assurance measures are both technical and organizational. Some common cases should be
        specified in a general Quality Assurance Plan which shall identify the key elements necessary to provide fitness
        of the structure and the means by which they are to be provided and measured with the overall purpose to provide
        confidence that the realized project will work satisfactorily in service fulfilling intended needs. The job of
        quality control and quality assurance would involve quality audit of both the inputs as well</p>
    <p>as the outputs. Inputs are in the form of materials for concrete, workmanship in all stages of batching, mixing,
        transportation, placing, compaction and curing; and the related plant, machinery and equipment;resulting in the
        output in the form of concrete in place. To ensure proper performance, it is necessary that each step in
        concreting which will he covered by the next step is inspected as the work proceeds (see also 17).</p>
    <p><b>10.1.3</b> Each party involved in the realization of a project should establish and implement a Quality
        Assurance Plan, for its participation in the project. Supplier's and subcontractor's activities shall be covered
        in the plan. The individual Quality Assurance Plans shall fit into the general Quality Assurance Plan. A Quality
        Assurance Plan shall define the tasks and</p>
    <p>responsibilities of all persons involved, adequate control and checking procedures, and the organization and
        maintaining adequate documentation of the building process and its results. Such documentation should generally
        include:</p>
    <p>a) test reports and manufacturer's certificate for materials, concrete mix design details;</p>
    <p>b) pour cards for site organization and clearance for, concrete placement;</p>
    <p>c) record of site inspection of workmanship, field tests;</p>
    <p>d) non-conformance reports, change orders;</p>
    <p>e) quality control charts; and</p>
    <p>f) statistical analysis.</p>
    <p>NOTE-Quality control charts are recommended wherever the concrete is in continuous production over considerable
        period.</p>
    <p id="h.lnxbz9"><b>10.2 Batching</b></p>
    <p>To avoid confusion and error in batching, consideration should be given to using the smallest practical number of
        different concrete mixes on any site of in anyone plant. In batching concrete, the quantity of both cement and
        aggregate shall be determined by mass; admixture, if solid, by mass; liquid admixture may however be measured in
        volume or mass; water shall be weighed or measured by volume in a calibrated tank (see also IS 4925).
        Ready-mixed concrete supplied by ready-mixed concrete plant shall be preferred. For large and medium project
        sites the concrete shall be sourced from ready mixed concrete plants or from on site or off site batching and
        mixing plants (see IS 4926).</p>
    <p><b>10.2.1</b> Except where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the engineer-in-charge that supply of properly
        graded aggregate of uniform quality can be maintained over a period of work, the grading of aggregate should be
        controlled by obtaining the coarse aggregate in different sizes and blending them 'in the right proportions when
        required, the different sizes being stocked in separate stock-piles. The material should be stock-piled for
        several hours preferably a day before use. The grading of coarse and fine aggregate should be checked as
        frequently as possible, the frequency for a given job being determined by the engineer-in-charge to ensure that
        the specified grading is maintained.</p>
    <p><b>10.2.2</b> The accuracy of the measuring equipment shall be within ± 2 percent of the quantity of cement being
        measured and within ± 3 percent of the quantity of aggregate, admixtures and water being measured.</p>
    <p><b>10.2.3</b> Proportion/Type and grading of aggregates shall be made by trial in such a way so as to obtain
        densest possible concrete. All ingredients of the concrete should be used by mass only.</p>
    <p><b>10.2.4</b> Volume batching may be allowed only where weigh-batching is not practical and provided accurate
        bulk densities of materials to be actually used in concrete have earlier been established. Allowance for bulking
        shall be made in accordance with IS 2386 (Part 3). The mass volume relationship should be checked as frequently
        as necessary, the frequency for the given job being determined by engineer-in-charge to ensure that the
        specified grading is maintained.</p>
    <p><b>10.2.5</b> It is important to maintain the water-cement ratio constant at its correct value. To this end,
        determination of moisture contents in both fine and coarse aggregates shall be made as frequently as possible,
        the frequency for a given job being determined by the engineer-in-charge according to weather conditions. The
        amount of the added water shall be adjusted to compensate for any observed variations in the moisture contents.
        For the determination of moisture content in the aggregates, IS 2386 (Part 3) may be referred to. To allow for
        the variation in mass of aggregate due to variation in their moisture content. suitable adjustments in the
        masses of aggregates shall also be made. In the absence of exact data, only in the case of nominal mixes, the
        amount of surface water may be estimated from the values given in Table 10.</p>

    <p><b>13.3.1</b> Concrete shall be compacted using mechanical vibrators complying with IS 2505, IS 2506, IS 2514 and
        IS 4656. Over vibration and under vibration of concrete are harmful and should be avoided. Vibration of very wet
        mixes should also be avoided.</p>
    <p>Whenever vibration has to be applied externally, the design of formwork and the disposition of vibrators should
        receive special consideration to ensure efficient compaction and to avoid surface blemishes.</p>
    <p><b>13.4 Construction of Joints and Cold Joints</b></p>
    <p>Joints are a common source of weakness and, therefore, it is desirable to avoid them. If this is not possible,
        their number shall be minimized. Concreting shall be carried out continuously up to construction joints, the
        position and arrangement of which shall be indicated by the designer. Construction joints should comply with lS
        11817.</p>
    <p>Construction joints shall be placed at accessible locations to permit cleaning out of laitance, cement slurry and
        unsound concrete, in order to create rough/ uneven surface. It is recommended to cleanout laitance and cement
        slurry by using wire brush on the surface of joint immediately after initial setting of concrete and to clean
        out the same immediately thereafter. The prepared surface should be in a clean saturated surface dry condition
        when fresh concrete is placed, against it.</p>
    <p>In the case of construction joints at locations where the previous pour has been cast against shuttering the
        recommended method of obtaining a rough surface for the previously poured concrete is to expose the aggregate
        with, a high-pressure water jet or any other appropriate means.</p>
    <p>Fresh concrete should be thoroughly vibrated near construction joints so that mortar from the new concrete flows
        between large aggregates and develop proper bond with old concrete.</p>
    <p>Where high shear resistance IS required at the construct ion joints, shear keys may be provided.</p>
    <p>Sprayed curing membranes and release agents should be thoroughly removed from joint surfaces.</p>
    <p><b>13.5 Curing</b></p>
    <p>Curing is the process of preventing the loss of moisture from the concrete whilst maintaining a satisfactory
        temperature regime. The prevention of moisture loss from the concrete is particularly important if the water
        cement ratio is low, if the cement has a high rate of strength development, if the concrete contains granulated
        blast furnace slag or pulverised fuel ash. The curing regime should also prevent the development of high
        temperature gradients within the concrete.</p>
    <p>The rate of strength development at early ages of concrete made with supersulphated cement is significantly
        reduced at lower temperatures. Supersulphated cement concrete is seriously affected by inadequate curing and the
        surface has to be kept moist for at least seven days.</p>
    <p><b>13.5.1 Moist Curing</b></p>
    <p>Exposed surfaces of concrete shall be kept continuously in a damp or wet condition by ponding or by covering with
        a layer of sacking, canvas, hessian, or similar materials and kept constantly wet for at least seven days from
        the date of placing concrete in case of ordinary Portland Cement and at least 10 days where mineral admixtures
        or blended cements are used. The period of curing shall not be less than 10 days for concrete exposed to dry and
        hot weather conditions. In the case of concrete where mineral admixtures or blended cements are used, it is
        recommended that above minimum periods may be extended to 14days.</p>
    <p><b>13.5.2 Membrane Curing</b></p>
    <p>Approved curing compounds may be used in lieu of moist curing with the permission of the engineer-in-charge. Such
        compounds shall be applied to all exposed surfaces of the concrete as soon as possible after the concrete has
        set. Impermeable membranes such as polyethylene sheeting covering closely the concrete surface may also be used
        to provide effective barrier against evaporation.</p>
    <p><b>13.5.3</b> For the concrete containing Portland pozzolana cement, Portland slag cement or mineral admixture,
        period of curing may be increased.</p>
    <p><b>13.6 Supervision</b></p>
    <p>It is exceedingly difficult and costly to alter concrete once placed. Hence, constant and strict supervision of
        all the items of the construction is necessary during the progress of the work, including the proportioning and
        mixing of the concrete. Supervision is also of extreme importance to check the reinforcement and its placing
        before being covered.</p>
    <p><b>13.6.1</b> Before any important operation, such as concreting or stripping of the formwork is started,
        adequate notice shall be given to the construction supervisor.</p>
    <p id="h.86gfqi9qoy6a">14 CONCRETING UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS</p>
    <p><b>14.1 Work in Extreme Weather Conditions</b></p>
    <p>During hot or cold weather, the concreting should be done as per the procedure set out in IS 7861 (Part 1) or IS
        7861 (Part 2).</p>
    <p><b>14.2 Under-Water Concreting</b></p>
    <p><b>14.2.1</b> When it is necessary to deposit concrete under water, the methods. equipment, materials and
        proportions of the mix to be used shall be submitted to and approved by the engineer-in-charge before the work
        is started.</p>
    <p><b>14.2.2</b> Under-water concrete should have a slump recommended in 7.1. The water-cement ratio shall not
        exceed 0.6 and may need to be smaller, depending on the grade of concrete or the type of chemical attack. For
        aggregates of 40 mm maximum particle size, the cement content shall be at least 350 kg/m<sup>3</sup> of
        concrete.</p>
    <p><b>14.2.3</b> Coffer-dams or forms shall be sufficiently tight to ensure still water if practicable, and in any
        case to reduce the flow of water to less than 3 m/min through the space into which concrete is to be deposited.
        Coffer-dams or forms in still water shall be sufficiently tight to prevent loss of mortar through the walls.
        De-watering by pumping shall not be done while concrete is being placed or until 24 h thereafter.</p>
    <p><b>14.2.4</b> Concrete cast underwater should not fall freely through the water. Otherwise, it may be leached and
        become segregated. Concrete shall be deposited continuously until it is brought to the required height. While
        depositing, the top surface shall be kept as nearly level as possible and the formation of seams avoided. The
        methods to be used for depositing concrete under water shall be one of the following:</p>
    <p>a) Tremie- The concrete is placed through vertical pipes the lower end of which is always inserted sufficiently
        deep into the concrete which has been placed previously but has not set. The concrete emerging from the pipe
        pushes the material that has already been placed to the side and upwards and thus does not come into direct
        contact with water.</p>
    <p>When concrete is to be deposited under water by means of tremie, shall be a hopper large enough to hold one
        entire batch of the mix or the entire contents the transporting bucket, if any. The tremie pipe shall be not
        less than 200 mm in diameter and shall be large enough to allow a free flow of concrete and strong enough to
        withstand the external pressure of the water in which it is suspended, even if a partial vacuum develops inside
        the pipe. Preferably, flanged steel pipe of adequate strength for the job should be used. A separate lifting
        device shall be provided for each tremie pipe with its hopper at the upper end. Unless the lower end of the pipe
        is equipped with an approved automatic check valve, the upper end of the pipe shall be plugged with a wadding of
        the gunny sacking or other approved material before delivering the concrete to the tremie pipe through the
        hopper, so that when the concrete is forced down from the hopper to the pipe, it will force the plug (and along
        with it any water in the pipe) down the pipe and out of the bottom end, thus establishing a continuous stream of
        concrete. It will be necessary to raise slowly the tremie in order to cause a uniform flow of the concrete, but
        the tremie shall not be emptied so that water enters the pipe. At all times after the placing of concrete is
        started and until all the concrete is placed, the lower end of the tremie pipe shall be below the top surface of
        the plastic concrete. This will cause the concrete to build up from below instead of flowing out over the
        surface, and thus avoid formation of laitance layers. If the charge in the tremie is lost while depositing, the
        tremie shall be raised above the concrete surface, and unless sealed by a check valve, it shall be re-plugged at
        the top end, as at the beginning, before refilling for depositing concrete.</p>
    <p>b) Direct placement with pumps- As in the case of the tremie method, the vertical end piece of the pipe line is
        always inserted sufficiently deep into the previously cast concrete and should not move to the side during
        pumping.</p>
    <p>c) Drop bottom bucket- The top of the bucket shall be covered with a canvas flap. The bottom doors shall open
        freely downward and outward when tripped. The bucket shall be filled completely and lowered slowly to avoid
        backwash. The bottom doors shall not be opened until the bucket rests on the surface upon which the concrete is
        to be deposited and when discharged, shall be withdrawn slowly until well above the concrete.</p>
    <p>d) Bags - Bags of at least 0.028 m<sup>3</sup> capacity of jute or other coarse cloth shall be filled about
        two-thirds full of concrete, the spare end turned under so that bag is square ended and securely tied. They
        shall be placed carefully in header and stretcher courses so that the whole mass is interlocked. Bags used for
        this purpose shall be free from deleterious materials.</p>
    <p>e) Grouting- A series of round cages made from 50 mm mesh of 6 mm steel and extending over the full height to be
        concreted shall be prepared and laid vertically over the area to be concreted so that the distance between
        centres of the cases and also to the faces of the concrete shall not exceed 1m. Stone aggregate of not less than
        50 mm nor more than 200 mm size shall be deposited outside the steel cages over the full area and height to be
        concreted with due care to prevent displacement of the cages.</p>
    <p>A stable 1:2 cement-sand grout with a water-cement ratio of not less than 0.6 and not more than 0.8 shall be
        prepared in a mechanical mixer and sent down under pressure (about 0.2 N/mm<sup>2</sup> ) through 38 to 50 mm
        diameter pipes terminating into steel cages, about 50 mm above the bottom of the concrete. As the grouting
        proceeds, the pipe shall be raised gradually up to a height of not more than 6000 mm above its starting, level
        after which it may be withdrawn and placed into the next cage for further grouting by the same procedure.</p>
    <p>After grouting the whole area for a height of about 600 mm, the same operation shall be repeated, if necessary,
        for the next layer of 600 mm and so on.</p>
    <p>The amount of grout to be sent down shall be sufficient to fill all the voids which may be either ascertained or
        assumed as 55 percent of the volume to be concreted.</p>
    <p><b>14.2.5</b> To minimize the formulation of laitance, great care shall be exercised not to disturb the concrete
        as far as possible while it is being deposited.</p>
    <p id="h.tiarr85smoeo">15 SAMPLING AND STRENGTH OF DESIGNED CONCRETE MIX</p>
    <p><b>15.1 General</b></p>
    <p>Samples from fresh concrete shall be taken as per IS 1199 and cubes shall be made, cured and tested at 28 days in
        accordance with IS 516.</p>
    <p><b>15.1.1</b> In order to get a relatively quicker idea of the quality of concrete, optional tests on beams for
        modulus of rupture at 72 ± 2 h or at 7 days, or compressive strength tests at 7 days may be carried out in
        addition to 28 days compressive strength test. For this purpose the values should be arrived at based on actual
        testing. In all cases, the 28 days compressive strength specified in Table 2 shall alone be the criterion for

    <p><b>SECTION-3 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATION</b></p>
    <p id="h.3tmvyc1lohq4">18 BASES FOR DESIGN</p>
    <p><b>18.1 Aim of design</b></p>
    <p>The aim of design is the achievement of an acceptable probability that structures being designed will perform
        satisfactorily during their intended life. With an appropriate degree of safety, they should sustain all the
        loads and deformations of normal construction and use and have adequate durability and adequate resistance to
        the effects of misuse and fire.</p>
    <p><b>18.2 Methods of Design</b></p>
    <p><b>18.2.1</b> Structure and structural elements shall normally be designed by Limit State Method. Account should
        be taken of accepted theories, experiment and experience and the need to design for durability. Calculations
        alone do not produce safe, serviceable and durable structures. Suitable materials, quality control, adequate
        detailing and good supervision are equally important.</p>
    <p><b>18.2.2</b> Where the Limit State Method cannot be conveniently adopted, Working Stress Method (see Annex B)
        may be used.</p>
    <p><b>18.2.3 Design Based on Experimental Basis</b></p>
    <p>Designs based on experimental investigations on models or full-size structure or element may be accepted if they
        satisfy the primary requirements of 18.1 and subject to experimental details and the analysis connected
        therewith being approved by the engineer-in-charge.</p>
    <p><b>18.2.3.1</b> Where the design is based on the experimental investigation on full-size structure or element,
        load tests shall be carried out to ensure the following:</p>
    <p>a) The structure shall satisfy the requirements for deflection (see 23.2) and cracking (see 35.3.2) when
        subjected to a load for 24 h equal to the characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 y<sub>f</sub>, where
        y<sub>f</sub> shall be taken from Table 18, for the limit state of serviceability. If within 24 h of the removal
        of the load, the structure does not show a recovery of at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown
        during the 24 h under the load, the test loading should be repeated after a lapse of 72 h. The recovery after
        the second test should be at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown during the second test.</p>
    <p>NOTE: If the maximum deflection in mm, shown during 24 h under load is less than 40L<sup>2</sup>/D where L is the
        effective span in m; and D is the overall depth of the section in mm, it is not necessary for the recovery to be
        measured.</p>
    <p>b) The structure shall have adequate strength to sustain for 24 h, a total load equal to the characteristic load
        multiplied by 1.33 y<sub>f</sub>, where y<sub>f</sub>, shall be taken from Table 18 for the limit state of
        collapse.</p>
    <p><b>18.3 Durability, Workmanship and Materials</b></p>
    <p>It is assumed that the quality of concrete, steel and other materials and of the workmanship, as verified by
        inspections, is adequate for safety, serviceability and durability.</p>
    <p><b>18.4 Design Process</b></p>
    <p>Design, including design for durability, construction and use in service should be considered as a whole. The
        realization of design objectives requires compliance with clearly defined standards for materials, production,
        workmanship and also maintenance and use of structure in service.</p>
    <p id="h.n08kd5yhr6yl">19 LOADS AND FORCES</p>
    <p><b>19.1 General</b></p>
    <p>In structural design, account shall be taken of the dead, imposed and wind loads and forces such as those caused
        by earthquake, and effect due to shrinkage, creep, temperature, etc, where applicable.</p>
    <p><b>19.2 Dead Loads</b></p>
    <p>Dead loads shall be calculated on the basis of unit weights which shall be established taking into consideration
        the materials specified for construction. 19.2.1 Alternatively, the dead loads may be calculated on the basis of
        unit weights of materials given in IS 875 (Part 1). Unless more accurate calculations are warranted, the unit
        weights of plain concrete and reinforced concrete made with sand and gravel or crushed natural stone aggregate
        may be taken as 24 KN/m<sup>3</sup> and 25 KN/m<sup>3</sup> respectively.</p>
    <p><b>19.3 Imposed Loads, Wind Loads and Snow Loads</b></p>
    <p>Imposed loads, wind loads and snow loads shall be assumed in accordance with IS 875 (Part 2), IS 875 (Part 3) and
        IS 875 (Part 4) respectively.</p>
    <p><b>19.4 Earthquake Forces</b></p>
    <p>The earthquake forces shall be calculated in accordance with IS 1893.</p>
    <p><b>19.5</b> Shrinkage, Creep and Temperature Effects If the effects of shrinkage, creep and temperature are
        liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability of the structure, these shall be taken into account in
        the calculations (see 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.2.6) and IS 875 (Part 5).</p>
    <p><b>19.5.1</b> In ordinary buildings, such as low-rise dwellings whose lateral dimension do not exceed 45 m, the
        effects due to temperature fluctuations and shrinkage and creep can be ignored in design calculations.</p>
    <p><b>19.6 Others Forces and Effects</b></p>
    <p>In addition, account shall be taken of the following forces and effects if they are liable to affect materially
        the safety and serviceability of the structure:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Foundation movement (see IS 1904),</li>
        <li>Elastic axial shortening,</li>
        <li>Soil and fluid pressures [see IS 875 (Part 5)],</li>
        <li>Vibration,</li>
        <li>Fatigue,</li>
        <li>Impact [see IS 875 (Part 5)],</li>
        <li>Erection loads [see IS 875 (Part 2)], and</li>
        <li>Stress concentration effect due to point load and the like.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>19.7 Combination of Loads</b></p>
    <p>The combination of loads shall be as given in IS 875 (Part 5).</p>
    <p><b>19.8 </b>Dead Load Counteracting Other Loads and Forces</p>
    <p>When dead load counteracts the effects due to other loads and forces in structural member or joint, special care
        shall be exercised by the designer to ensure adequate safety for possible stress reversal.</p>
    <p><b>19.9 Design Load</b></p>
    <p>Design load is the load to be taken for use in the appropriate method of design; it is the characteristic load in
        case of working stress method and characteristic load with appropriate partial safety factors for limit state
        design.</p>
    <p id="h.i4mgs33bxznt">20.STABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE</p>
    <p><b>20.1 Overturning</b></p>
    <p>The stability of a structure as a whole against overturning shall be ensured so that the restoring moment shall
        be not less than the sum of 1.2 times the maximum overturning moment due to the characteristic dead load and 1.4
        times the maximum overturning moment due to the characteristic imposed loads. In cases where dead load provides
        the restoring moment, only 0.9 times the characteristic dead load shall be considered.Restoring moment due to
        imposed loads shall be ignored.</p>
    <p><b>20.1.1</b> The anchorages or counterweights provided for overhanging members (during construction and service)
        should be such that static equilibrium should remain, even when overturning moment is doubled.</p>
    <p><b>20.2 Sliding</b></p>
    <p>The structure shall have a factor against sliding of not less than 1.4 under the most adverse the most adverse
        combination of the applied characteristic forces.In this case only 0.9 times the characteristic dead load shall
        be taken into account.</p>
    <p><b>20.3 Probable Variation in Dead Load</b></p>
    <p>To ensure stability at all times, account shall be taken of probable variations in dead load during construction,
        repair or other temporary measures. Wind and seismic loading shall be treated as imposed loading.</p>
    <p><b>20.4 Moment Connection</b></p>
    <p>In designing the framework of a building provisions shall be made by adequate moment connections or by a system
        of bracings to effectively transmit all the horizontal forces to the foundations.</p>
    <p><b>20.5 Lateral Sway</b></p>
    <p>Under transient wind load the lateral sway at the top should not exceed H/500, where H is the total height of the
        building. For seismic loading, reference should be made to IS 1893.</p>
    <p id="h.2fykvb7bzrti">21 FIRE RESISTANCE</p>
    <p><b>21.1</b> A structure or structural element required to have fire resistance should be designed to possess an
        appropriate degree of resistance to flames penetration; heat transmission and failure.The fire resistance of a
        structural element is expressed in terms of time in hours in accordance with IS 1641. Fire resistance of
        concrete elements depends upon details of member size, cover to steel reinforcement detailing and type of
        aggregate (normal weight or light weight ) used in concrete.General requirements for fire protection are given
        in IS 1642.</p>
    <p><b>21.2</b> Minimum requirements of concrete cover and member dimensions for normal-weight aggregate concrete
        members so as to have the required fire resistance shall be in accordance with 26.4.3 and Fig. 1 respectively.
    </p>
    <p><b>21.3</b> The reinforcement detailing should reflect the changing pattern of the structural section and ensure
        that both individual elements and the structure as a whole contain adequate support, ties, bonds and anchorages
        for the required fire resistance.</p>
    <p><b>21.3.1</b> Additional measures such as applications of fire resistant finishes, provision of fire resistant
        false ceilings and sacrificial steel in tensile zone, should be adopted in case the nominal cover required
        exceeds 40mm for beams and 35 mm for slabs, to give protection against spalling.</p>

    <p>All structures may be analysed by the linear elastic theory to calculate internal actions produced by designed
        loads. In lieu of rigorous elastic analysis, a simplified analysis as given in 22.4 for frames and as given in
        22.5 for continuous beams may be adopted.</p>
    <p><b>22.2 Effective Span</b></p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, the effective span of a membrane shall be as follows:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Simply Supported Beam or Slab – The effective span of a member that is not built integrally with its
            supports shall be taken as clear span plus the effective depth of slab or beam or centre to centre of
            supports, whichever is less.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>b) Continuous Beam or Slab - In the case of continuous beam or slab, if the width of the support is less than
        1/12 of the clear span, the effective span shall be as in <b>22.2</b> (a). If the supports are wider than 1/12
        of the clear span or 600 mm whichever is less, the effective span shall be taken as under:</p>
    <p>1) For end span with one end fixed and the other continuous or for intermediate spans, the effective span shall
        be the clear span between supports;</p>
    <p>2) For end span with one end free and the other continuous, the effective span shall be equal to the clear span
        plus half the effective depth of the beam or slab or the clear span plus half the width of the discontinuous
        support, whichever is less;</p>
    <p>3) In the case of spans with roller or rocket bearings, the effective span shall always be the distance between
        the centres of bearings.</p>
    <p>c) Cantilever-The effective length of a cantilever shall be taken as its length to the face of the support plus
        half the effective depth except where it forms the end of a continuous beam where the length to the centre of
        support shall be taken.</p>
    <p>d) Frames - In the analysis of a continuous frame, centre to centre distance shall be used.</p>

    <p id="h.2xgjk12b4kp9"><b>22.3.1 Relative Stiffness</b></p>
    <p>The relative stiffness of the members may be based on the moment of inertia of the section determined on the
        basis of any one of the following definitions:</p>
    <p>a) Gross section- The cross-section of the member ignoring reinforcement;</p>
    <p>b) Transformed section- The concrete cross-section plus the area of reinforcement transformed on the basis of
        modular ratio (see <b>B-1.3</b>);or</p>
    <p>c) Cracked section - The area of concrete in compression plus the area of reinforcement transformed on the basis
        of modular ratio.</p>
    <p>The assumptions made shall be consistent for all the members of the structure throughout any analysis.</p>
    <p><b>22.3.2</b> For deflection calculations, appropriate values of moment of inertia is specified in Annex C should
        be used.</p>

    <p>The simplifying assumptions as given in <b>22.4.1</b> to <b>22.4.3</b> may be used in the analysis of frames.</p>
    <p id="h.8787vhb0mksu"><b>22.4.1 Arrangement of Imposed Load</b></p>
    <p>a) Consideration may be limited to combinations of:</p>

    <p>2) Design dead load on all spans with full design imposed load on alternate spans.</p>
    <p>b) When design imposed load does not exceed three-fourths of the design dead load, the load arrangement may be
        design dead load and design imposed load on all the spans.</p>

    <p id="h.zai23qblp4bo"><b>22.4.2 Substitute Frame</b></p>
    <p>For determining the moments and shears at any floor or roof level due to gravity loads, the beams at that level
        together with columns above and below with their far ends fixed may be considered to constitute the frame.</p>
    <p><b>22.4.2.1</b> Where side sway consideration becomes critical due to unsymmetry in geometry or loading, rigorous
        analysis may be required.</p>
    <p><b>22.4.3</b> For lateral loads, simplified methods may be used to obtain the moments and shears for structures

    <p><b>22.5.1</b> Unless more exact estimates are. made, for beams of uniform cross-section which support
        substantially uniformly distributed loads over three or more spans which do not differ by more than 15 percent
        of the longest, the bending moments and shear forces used in design may be obtained using the coefficients given
        in Table 12 and Table 13 respectively.</p>
    <p>For moments at supports where two unequal spans meet or in case where the spans are not equally loaded, the
        average of the two values for the negative moment at the support may be taken for design.</p>

    <p>The bending moments and shear forces may be determined by an analysis of the structure as a continuous frame and
        the following assumptions may be made:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>The structure shall be considered to be made up of equivalent frames on column lines taken longitudinally
            and transversely through the building. Each frame consists of a row of equivalent columns or supports,
            bounded laterally by the centre-line of the panel on each side of the centre-line of the columns or
            supports. Frames adjacent and parallel to an edge shall be bounded by the edge and the centre-line of the
            adjacent panel.</li>
        <li>Each such frame may be analysed in its entirety, or, for vertical loading, each floor thereof and the roof
            may be analysed separately with its columns being assumed fixed at their remote ends. Where slabs are thus
            analysed separately, it may be assumed in determining the bending moment at a given support that the slab is
            fixed at any support two panels distant therefrom provided the slab continues beyond the point.</li>
        <li>For the purpose of determining relative stiffness of members, the moment of inertia of any slab or column
            may be assumed to be that of the gross cross-section of the concrete alone.</li>
        <li>Variations of moment of inertia along the axis of the slab on account of provision of drops shall be taken
            into account. In the case of recessed or coffered slab which is made solid in the region of the columns, the
            stiffening effect may be ignored provided the solid part of the slab does not extend more than 0.15
            l<sub>ef</sub>, into the span measured from the centre-line of the columns. The stiffening effect of flared
            column heads may be ignored.</li>

    <p><b>SECTION 5 STRUCTURAL DESIGN (LIMIT STATE OF METHOD)</b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b>35 SAFETY AND SERVICEABILITY REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
    <p><b>35.1 General</b></p>
    <p>In the method of design based on the limit state concept, the structure shall be designed to withstand safely all
        loads liable to act on it throughout its life; it shall also satisfy the serviceability requirements, such as
        limitations on deflection and cracking. The acceptable limit for the safety and serviceability requirements
        before failure occurs is called a 'limit state'. The aim of design is to achieve acceptable probabilities that
        the structure will not become unfit for the use for which it is intended, that is, that it will not reach a
        limit state</p>
    <p><b>35.1.1</b> All relevant limit states shall be considered in design to ensure an adequate degree of safety and
        serviceability. In general, the structure shall be designed on the basis of the most critical limit state and
        shall be checked for other limit states.</p>
    <p><b>35.1.2</b> For ensuring the above objective, the design should be based on characteristic values for material
        strengths and applied loads, which take into account the variations in the material strengths and in the loads
        to be supported. The characteristic values should be based on statistical data if available; where such data are
        not available, they should be based on experience. The 'design values' are derived from the characteristic
        values through the use of partial safety factors, one for material strengths and the other for loads. In the
        absence of special considerations these factors should have the values given in <b>36</b> according to the
        material, the type of loading and the limit state being considered.</p>
    <p><b>35.2 Limit State of Collapse</b></p>
    <p>The limit state of collapse of the structure or part of the structure could be assessed from rupture of one or
        more critical sections and from buckling due to elastic or plastic instability (including the effects of sway
        where appropriate) or overturning. The resistance to bending, shear, torsion, and axial loads at every section
        shall not be less than the appropriate value at that section produced by the probable most unfavourable
        combination of loads on the structure using the appropriate partial safety factors.</p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b>35.3 Limit States of Serviceability</b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b>35.3.1 Deflection</b></p>
    <p>Limiting values of deflections are given in <b>23.2.</b></p>
    <p><b>35.3.2 Cracking</b></p>
    <p>Cracking of concrete should not adversely affect the appearance or durability of the structure; the acceptable
        limits of cracking would vary with the type of structure and environment. Where specific attention is required
        to limit the designed crack width to a particular value, crack width calculation may be done using formula given

    <p>The practical objective of calculating crack width is merely to give guidance to the designer in making
        appropriate structural arrangements and in avoiding gross errors in design, which might result in concentration
        and excessive width of flexural crack. The surface width of the cracks should not, in general exceed 0.3 mm in
        members where cracking is not harmful and does not have any serious adverse effects upon the preservation of
        reinforcing steel nor upon the durability of the structures. In members where cracking in the tensile zone is
        harmful either because they are exposed to the effects of the weather or continuously exposed to moisture or in
        contact soil or ground water, an upper limit of 0.2 mm is suggested for the maximum width of cracks. For
        particularly aggressive environment, such as the 'severe` category in Table 3, the assessed surface width of
        cracks. should not in general, exceed 0.1 mm.</p>

    <p><b>36.1 Characteristic Strength of Materials</b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p>The term ‘characteristic strength’ means that value of the strength of the material below which not more than 5
        percent of the test results are expected to fall. The characteristic strength for concrete shall be in
        accordance with Table 2. Until the relevant Indian Standard Specifications for reinforcing steel are modified to
        include the concept of characteristic strength, the characteristic value shall be assumed as the minimum yield
        stress /0.2 percent proof stress specified in the relevant Indian Standard Specifications.</p>
    <p><b>36.2 Characteristic Loads</b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p>The term 'characteristic load' means that value of load which has a 95 percent probability of not being exceeded
        during the life of the structure. Since data are not available tb express loads in statistical terms, for the
        purpose of this standard, dead loads given in IS 875 (Part 1), imposed loads given in IS 875 (Part 2), wind
        loads given in IS 875 (Part 3), snow load as given in IS 875 (Part 4) and seismic forces given in IS 1893 shall
        be assumed as the characteristic loads.</p>

        <li>In the case of a braced column without any transverse loads occurring in its height, the additional moment
            shall be added to, an initial moment equal to sum of 0.4 M<sub>u1</sub> and 0.6 M<sub>u2</sub> where
            M<sub>u2</sub> is the larger end moment and M<sub>u1</sub> is the smaller end moment (assumed negative if
            the column is bent in double curvature). In no case shall the initial moment be less than 0.4 MU2 nor the
            total moment including the initial moment be less than M<sub>.u2</sub>. For unbraced columns, the additional
            moment shall be added to the end moments.</li>
        <li>Unbraced compression members, at any given level or storey, subject to lateral load are usually constrained
            to deflect equally. In such cases the slenderness ratio for each column may be taken as the average for all

    <p><b>40.5 Enhanced Shear Strength of Sections Close to Supports</b></p>
    <p><b>40.5.1</b> General</p>
    <p>Shear failure at sections of beams and cantilevers without shear reinforcement will normally occur on a plane
        inclined at an angle 30° to the horizontal. If the angle of the failure plane is forced to be inclined more
        steeply than this [because the section considered (X - X) in Fig. 24 is close to a support or for other reasons
        1, the shear force required to produce failure is increased.</p>
    <p>The enhancement of shear strength may be taken into account in the design of sections near a support by
        increasing design shear strength of concrete to <img src="images/image103.png">provided that design shear stress
        at the face of the support remains less than the values given in Table 20. Account may be taken of the
        enhancement in any situation where the section considered is closer to the face of a support or concentrated
        load than twice the effective depth, d. To be effective, tension reinforcement should extend on each side of the
        point where it is intersected by a possible failure plane for a distance at least equal to the effective depth,
        or be provided with an equivalent anchorage.</p>
    <p><b>40.5.2 Shear Reinforcement for Sections Close to Supports</b></p>
    <p>If shear reinforcement is required, the total area of this is given by:</p>
    <p><img src="images/image104.png"></p>
    <p>This reinforcement should be provided within the middle three quarters of a<sub>v</sub>, where a<sub>v</sub> is
        less than d, horizontal shear reinforcement will be more effective than vertical.</p>
    <p><b>40.5.3 Enhanced Shear Strength Near Supports (Simplified Approach)</b></p>
    <p>The procedure given in <b>40.5.1</b> and <b>40.5.2</b> may be used for all beams. However for beams carrying
        generally uniform load or where the principal load is located farther than 2d from the face of support, the
        shear stress may be calculated at a section a distance d from the face of support. The value of l' is calculated
        in , v accordance with Table 19 and appropriate shear reinforcement is provided at sections closer to the
        support, no further check for shear at such sections is required, <span

    <p><b>41 LIMIT STATE OF COLLAPSE: TORSION</b></p>
    <p><b>41.1 General</b></p>
    <p>In structures, where torsion is required to maintain equilibrium, members shall be designed for torsion in
        accordance with <b>41.2</b>, <b>41.3</b> and <b>41.4</b>. However, for such indeterminate structures where
        torsion can be eliminated by releasing redundant restraints, no specific design for torsion is necessary,
        provided torsional stiffness is neglected in the calculation of internal forces. Adequate control of any
        torsional cracking is provided by the shear reinforcement as per <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p id="h.68rd3bdnp21l">NOTE - The approach to design in this clause is as follows: Torsional reinforcement is not
        calculated separately from that required for bending and shear. Instead the total longitudinal reinforcement is
        determined for a fictitious bending moment which is a function of actual bending moment and torsion;similarly
        web reinforcement is determined for a fictitious shear which is a function of actual shear and torsion,</p>
    <p><b>41.1.1</b> The design rules laid down in 41.3 and 41.4 shall apply to beams of solid rectangular
        cross-section. However, these clauses may also be applied to flanged beams, by substituting b. for b in which
        case they are generally conservative; therefore specialist literature may be referred to.</p>
    <p id="h.itnd0h190wm1"><b>41.2 Critical Section</b></p>
    <p>Sections located less than a distance d, from the face of the support may be designed for the same torsion as
        computed at a distance d, where d is the effective depth.</p>

    <p><b>41.3.2</b> If the equivalent nominal shear stress, ꚍ<sub>ve</sub> does not exceed ꚍ<sub>c</sub> given in Table
        19, minimum shear reinforcement shall be provided as per 26.5.1.6.</p>
    <p><b>41.3.3</b> If ꚍ<sub>ve</sub> exceeds ꚍ<sub>c</sub> given in Table 19, both , longitudinal and transverse

    <p><b>42.1</b> <b>Flexural Members</b></p>
    <p>In all normal cases, the deflection of a flexural member will not be excessive if the ratio of its span to its
        effective depth is not greater than appropriate ratios given in 23.2.1. When deflections are calculated
        according to Annex C, they shall not exceed the permissible values given in.23.2.</p>

    <p><b>43.1 </b><b>Flexural Members</b><b></b></p>
    <p>In general, compliance with the spacing requirements of reinforcement given in <b>26.3.2</b> should be sufficient
        to control flexural cracking. If greater spacing is required, the expected crack width should be checked by the
        formula given in Annex F.</p>
    <p><b>43.2</b> <b>Compression Members</b><b></b></p>
    <p>Cracks due to bending in a compression member subjected to a design axial load greater than 0.21fck Ac, where
        f<sub>ck</sub> is the characteristic compressive strength of concrete and Ac is the area of the gross section of

    <p>The general design requirements of Section 3 shall apply to this Annex.</p>
    <p><sub></sub></p>
    <p><b>B-1.2</b><b> </b><b>Redistribution of Moments</b></p>
    <p>Except where the simplified analysis using coefficients (see <b>22.5</b>) is used, the moments over the supports
        for any assumed arrangement of loading, including the dead load moments may each he increased or decreased by
        not more than 15 percent, provided that these modified moments over the supports are used for the calculation of
        the corresponding moments in the spans.</p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b>B-1.3 Assumptions for Design of Members</b></p>
    <p>In the methods based on elastic theory, the following assumptions shall be made:</p>
    <p>a) At any cross-section, plane sections before bending remain plain after bending.</p>
    <p>b) All tensile stresses are taken up by reinforcement Rod none by concrete, except as otherwise specifically
        permitted.</p>
    <p>c) The stress-strain relationship of steel and concrete, under working loads, is a straight line.</p>
    <p>d) The modular ratio m has the value <img src="images/image109.png"></p>
    <p>where σ<sub>cbc</sub> is permissible compressive stress due to bending in concrete in N/mm<sup>2</sup> as
        specified in Table 21.</p>
    <p>NOTE - The expression given for m partially takes into account long-term effects such as creep. Therefore, this m
        is not the same as the modular ratio derived based on the value of E<sub>c</sub> given in <b>6.2.3.1.</b></p>

        be obtained by interpolation between the grades of concrete.</p>

    <p>𝜏<sub>v </sub>= <img src="images/image134.png"></p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p>V = shear force due to design loads,</p>
    <p>b = breadth of the member, which for flanged sections shall be taken as the breadth of the web, and</p>
    <p>d = effective depth.</p>
    <p>B-5.1.1 Beams of Varying Depth</p>
    <p>In the case of beams of varying depth, the equation shall be modified as:</p>
    <p>𝜏 = <img src="images/image135.png"></p>
    <p>Where</p>
    <p>𝜏, V, b and d are the same as in<b> B-5.1</b>,</p>
    <p>M= bending moment at the section, and</p>
    <p>B= angle between the top and the bottom edges of the beam.</p>
    <p>The negative sign in the formula applies when the bending moment M increases numerically in the same direction as
        the effective depth d increases, and the positive sign when the moment decreases numerically in this direction.

    <p><b>B-5.5.3</b> Enhanced Shear Strength Near Supports (Simplified Approach)</p>
    <p>The procedure given in B-5.5.1 and B-5.5.2 may be used for all beams. However for beams carrying generally
        uniform load or where the principal load is located further than 2d from the face of support, the shear stress
        may be calculated at a section a distance d from the face of support. The value of <img
            src="images/image47.png">is calculated in accordance with Table 23 and appropriate shear reinforcement is
        provided at sections closer to the support, no further check for such section is required.</p>
    <p id="h.6v8c637s9imo">B-6 TORSION</p>
    <p><b>B-6.1 General</b></p>
    <p>In structures where torsion is required to maintain equilibrium, members shall be designed for torsion in
        accordance with <b>B-6.2</b>, <b>B-6.3</b> and <b>B-6.4</b>. However, for such indeterminate structures where
        torsion can be eliminated by releasing redundant restraints, no specific design for torsion is necessary
        provided torsional stiffness is neglected in the calculation of internal forces. Adequate control of any
        torsional cracking is provided by the shear reinforcement as per <b>B-5</b>.</p>
    <p>NOTE- The approach to design in this clause for torsion is as follows:</p>
    <p>Torsional reinforcement is not calculated separately from that required for bending and shear. Instead, the total
        longitudinal reinforcement is determined for a fictitious bending moment which is a function of actual bending
        moment and torsion; similarly, web reinforcement is determined for a fictitious shear which is a function of
        actual shear and torsion.</p>
    <p><b>B-6.1.1</b> The design rules laid down in <b>B-6.3</b> and <b>B-6.4</b> shall apply to beams of solid
        rectangular cross-section. However, these clauses may also be applied to flanged beams by substituting <img
            src="images/image99.png"> for <img src="images/image150.png">, in which case they are generally
        conservative; therefore specialist literature may be referred to.</p>
    <p><b>B-6.2 Critical Section</b></p>
    <p>Sections located less than a distance d. from the face of the support maybe designed for the same torsion as
        computed at a distance d, where d is the effective depth,</p>

    <p>(Clauses 35.3.2 and 43.1)</p>
    <p id="h.z1twjj19gd0c"><b>CALCULATION OF CRACK WIDTH</b></p>
    <p>Provided that the strain in the tension reinforcement is limited to 0.8 <img src="images/image196.png">, the
        design surface crack width, which should not exceed the appropriate value given in <b>35.3.2</b> may be
        calculated from the following equation:</p>
    <p>Design surface crack width</p>
    <p><img src="images/image197.png"></p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p><img src="images/image198.png">= distance from the point considered to the surface of the nearest longitudinal
        bar,</p>
    <p><img src="images/image199.png">= minimum cover to the longitudinal bar ;</p>
    <p><img src="images/image200.png">= average steel strain at the level considered,</p>
    <p>h=overall depth of the member, and</p>
    <p>x=depth of the neutral axis.</p>
    <p>The average steel strain <img src="images/image200.png"> may be calculated on the basis of the following
        assumption:</p>
    <p>The concrete and the steel are both considered to be fully elastic in tension and in compression. The elastic
        modulus of the steel may be taken as 200 KN/<img src="images/image70.png"> and the elastic modulus of the
        concrete is as derived from the equation given in <b>6.2.3.1</b> both in compression and in tension.</p>
    <p>These assumptions are illustrated in Fig. 28,</p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p>h = the overall depth of the section,</p>
    <p>x = the depth from the compression face to the neutral axis,</p>
    <p><img src="images/image201.png"> = the maximum compressive stress in the concrete,</p>
    <p><img src="images/image202.png">= the tensile stress in the reinforcement, and</p>
    <p><img src="images/image203.png">= the modulus of elasticity of the reinforcement.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, as an approximation, it will normally be satisfactory to calculate the steel stress on the basis
        of a cracked section and then reduce this by an amount equal to the tensile force generated by the triangular
